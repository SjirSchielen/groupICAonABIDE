This folder contains the subfolders: 'Matlab', 'Python', 'and ICA_AROMA_MASKS'.

All Python parts and the 'ICA_AROMA_MASKS' follow the original implementation of ICA-AROMA:
https://github.com/maartenmennes/ICA-AROMA. The only adaptation made here is that the
ICA-AROMA.py and the ICA_AROMA_FUNCTIONS.py scripts are changed to use FSL in Windows
subsystem for Linux. This change is only made for the case in which this dataset is run (
2x2x2 mm voxels in MNI space). If you do not use Windows subsystem for Linux or you want to
run different parts of the script, it is best to use the original scripts. Using the scripts 
provided here will require to change the paths in the scripts. 

The Matlab folder contains the Matlab code used for preprocessing. These scripts were made by
Sjir Schielen and Jesper Pilmeyer based on work by Stephan Heunis:
 https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4527532 . We used these files as a basis for many functions.

If you want to use the code provided on this GitHub page, it involves changing the file paths
in your desired way. The main preprocessing script is preprocess_ABIDE_realignmentfirst.m, which
involves all the steps of taking a raw functional and T1-weighted scan to yield a preprocessed
functional scan. The preprocessed volumes were used in FSL's MELODIC, which was run from the script
'groupMelodic.m', where the mask called 'groupMask.nii' was used. The output of groupMelodic.m
and the preprocessed volumes were used in dual regression to obtain the time series provided
 in groupICAonABIDE/data/ABIDE.zip. 

Additionally, there is the 'phenotypicDataLoader.ipynb' which contains sample Python code to 
read the phenotypic information that is also provided in groupICAonABIDE/data/ABIDE.zip.
